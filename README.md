## Project Overview
Adjust Robin's current web app to include all four images of Mars's hemisphere from Mars’s hemispheres online that are scrape friendly. 
**Requirement**: To scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

### Deliverable 1- Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Made updates to Jupyter notebook for scraping

### Deliverable 2 - Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles
Downloaded jupyter notebook as .py file. Made updates to other .py files as scraping_challenge, app_challenge
Index-d2 file has the code. Upon running it, shows all the four hemispheres.

### Deliverable 3- Add Bootstrap 3 Components
Index file has the updated code. Upon running it, the final deliverable requirements are met.
